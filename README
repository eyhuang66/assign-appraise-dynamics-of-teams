This code introduced a mathematical model for collective learning within a team. Under certain conditions, the team is capable of maximizing their collective performance.

In this model, the appraisal network represents the network structure of the team, where the weighted edges represent team members' evaluations of one another. Additionally, each team member chooses their own workload in a decentralized and distributed manner, based on the current appraisal network. The appraisal network than co-evolves with the observed individual performances. 

To run an example case, execute ./main_example.
